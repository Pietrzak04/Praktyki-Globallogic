## About The Project :mag:

Autox is a group project that is implemented by a five-person team taking part in a internship program at GlobalLogic. The program was created to explore the topic of modern cars subsystems communication. Our goal is to create a demo, that is easy to use and understand the code behind it.

Autox works by using the CAN BUS to take user input and pass it down to the individual components that execute the desired action for example left window down! In the same time the CLI displays symbols that convey to the user the action that is being executed.
